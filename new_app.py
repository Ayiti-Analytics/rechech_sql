Given the following database table schema:

Table Name: py_clinician_mips_2021
Variables:
- NPI: Unique clinician ID assigned by NPPES.
- Ind_PAC_ID: Unique individual clinician ID assigned by PECOS.
- lst_nm: Individual clinician last name.
- frst_nm: Individual clinician first name.
- APM_affl_1: Name of the Alternative Payment Model (APM) in which the individual eligible clinician participates (first affiliation).
- APM_affl_2: Name of the Alternative Payment Model (APM) in which the individual eligible clinician participates (second affiliation).
- APM_affl_3: Name of the Alternative Payment Model (APM) in which the individual eligible clinician participates (third affiliation).
- measure_cd: Components of measure code: [program][reporting_entity][measure_number]_[stratum], where program is defined as MIPS, QCDR, PI, or IA; reporting entity is indicated as EC for individual eligible clinician; measure number denotes the measure number or string identifier; and stratum indicates whether it is an overall rate or a single stratum.
- measure_title: Measure or attestation title.
- invs_msr: Indicator for whether a measure is an inverse measure.
- attestation_value: Attestation value.
- prf_rate: Measure performance rate (numeric).
- patient_count: Number of patients included in the measure denominator (numeric).
- star_value: Star rating, assigned based on performance at the measure, stratum, collection type, and entity type level (numeric).
- five_star_benchmark: The established ABCâ„¢ benchmark used to assign a five-star rating for a given measure and collection type (numeric).
- collection_type: Collection types are defined as ATT for Web Attestation, CLM for Claims, EHR for Electronic Health Record, QCDR for Qualified Clinical Data Registry, and REG for Qualified Registry. Note: Collection type is not published for PI and IA attestations.
- CCXP_ind: Indicator for whether the measure/attestation is reported on Care Compare profile pages (i.e., measures with an N value are only available in the PDC).
